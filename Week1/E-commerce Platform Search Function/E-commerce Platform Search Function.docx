Big O Notation:

Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's running time as a function of input size n. It helps to analyze how well an algorithm scales and determines its efficiency.
O(1) – Constant time
O(log n) – Logarithmic time
O(n) – Linear time
O(n log n) – Log-linear time
O(n²) – Quadratic time

Search Scenarios:
Best Case: Item is found in the first few comparisons.
Average Case: Item is found somewhere in the middle.
Worst Case: Item is not found, or it's the last item in the dataset.

| Algorithm     | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| Linear Search | O(1)      | O(n)         | O(n)       |
| Binary Search | O(1)      | O(log n)     | O(log n)   |

 
Analysis

Time Complexity:
Algorithm	Time Complexity	Notes
Linear Search	O(n)	Simple but slow for large datasets
Binary Search	O(log n)	Requires sorted array, much faster

Best Fit for Platform:
Small product lists → Linear search may suffice.
Large product catalog (like Amazon) → Binary search or even advanced data structures (e.g., Trie, B-Trees, or full-text search engines like Elasticsearch) are recommended.

Conclusion:
Binary search is far more efficient if data is sorted and static or infrequently updated.
