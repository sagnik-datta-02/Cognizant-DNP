What is Recursion?
Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. A recursive function calls itself until a base condition is met.

Why Use Recursion?

Recursion can simplify code for problems that have a natural hierarchical structure.
Ideal for tasks like factorials, Fibonacci sequences, tree traversals, and financial forecasts involving repeated patterns.

Analysis
Time Complexity:
Each recursive call reduces years by 1, and we stop when years == 0.
So, there are n recursive calls.
